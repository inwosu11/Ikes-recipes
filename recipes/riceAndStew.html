        Rice and Stew

    <p>
        Growing up this was my favorite meal to eat when I wake up, come home from school, or even just as a small snacky snack. Rice and stew is a typically 
        west african style food that you will find that many different cultures across the coast have theyre own special variation in the way that they may cook their own.

        parboiled or jasmine rice, and fried plantain. And a cold drink of choice with out 
        further-a-do lets get into the preperation:
