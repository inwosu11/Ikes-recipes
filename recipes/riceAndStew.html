        Rice and Stew
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        Growing up this was my favorite meal to eat when I wake up, come home from school, or even just as a small snacky snack. Rice and stew is a typically 
        west african style food that you will find that many different cultures across the coast have theyre own special variation in the way that they may cook their own.

        <b>As for me!</b> I enjoy this special delicacy, with beef, chicken, 
        parboiled or jasmine rice, and fried plantain. And a cold drink of choice with out 
        further-a-do lets get into the preperation:

        Lets make this dish!
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Boil Rice (Easy if you have a rice cooker)</li>
        <li>Cut onion, tomato, bell pepper in halves and place on a rack. Then place in oven till theres little charing on the top of them.</li>
        <li><b>Lets make the Broth:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash both Chicken and beef</li>
                <li>In pot place washed meat</li>
                <li>Add Salt, bay leaves, maggi cubes, onions, chicken bouleon seasoning, black pepper, habanero (minced)</li>
                <li>Add very little water</li>
                <li>cover pot and cook on low/medium heat</li>
                <li> After chicken is nearly falling off the bone from firm touch take them all out one by one.</li>
                <li> Keep the remaingin broth</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>once the veggies in the oven have finished charring bring them out and drain possible water accumulated on pan</li>
        <li>Add vegies to blender, with a couple habanero peppers. Blend till it has became a sauce with no chunks</li>
        <li>Mince onions, and open all tomato tins</li>
        <li><b>Now to put it all together:</b></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab a nice pot</li>
            <li>Add oil that will create a small puddle of oil in the pot (not too much oil though)</li>
            <li>Add minced onions</li>
            <li> once onions have cooked for a few minutes and shriveled a bit </li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and cook in the oil and onions</li>
            <li>once you have fried the tomato paste till it has pores, Add chicken broth</li>
            <li>After these cook together then this is where youd like to do your first taste test.(Should not be sweet)</li>
            <li>Now add blended sauce</li>
            <li>Add some bay leaves, salt and habanero peppers to bring up the taste to liking</li>
            <li><b>Keep in mind that the stew will cook down and the water will evaporate from the stew, which will condense the stew so be careful adding heavy seasoning because it will be very present in the finished stew</b></li>
            <li> After stew has cooked down, and is at taste, add all meat and litely stir the meat into the stew, lower the heat</li>
            <li>let it cook for another 10 mins so the meats can absorb some of the sauce</li>
            <li>Take stew off stove let sit for 5 mins or so before serving</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Remember to eat with fried plantain, link to that is below</li>
        <li>Enjoy my friend!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
